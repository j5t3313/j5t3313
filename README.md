# Jessica Steele

**Data Scientist** specializing in statistical modeling, simulation, and time-series analysis.

I build end-to-end analytics systems, from data pipelines and Bayesian inference to interactive dashboards. My portfolio applies these techniques to Formula 1, where telemetry data and complex decision-making create rich problems for ML and simulation.
